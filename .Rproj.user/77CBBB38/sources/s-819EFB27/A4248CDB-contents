# Ct MAP analysis

Code for analysis of minor allele distributions in Chlamydia trachomatis pull-down genome sequencing project

 The original input files were created from mpileup output of Ct genomes mapped against the serovar D genome

```MAP_file_pipeline``` script was used to create plots 
Inputs - mpileup files
Outputs ```MAP_files```

```analyzing_MAP_pipeline_results.Rmd```  
Inputs ``````MAP_files``` and reports stats about iSNPs(SNVs).
Outputs the ```Pos_count.tsv``` file for the numbers of times each iSNP occurs in the 87 original high_quality samples.

```snippy_analysis.Rmd``` identifies the canonical (cSNPs) and 
outputs lists of positions that discriminate T1 and T2 clades including ```T1T2_denovo_snps```

```fastGEAR_ancrestral_recombination`` and ```fastgear_recent_recombination``` pipelines analyse the output of fastGEAR analysis and make plots and gather stats. Als produce the ```fastgear_fiji_recombs``` file of recombinant positions.

```SNP_pipelines``` analyzes SNPs for each strains and produces graphics for Figure 3-5 and supplement.  
INputs are ``Pos_count.tsv```, ```fastgear_fiji_recombs```,```MAP_files```, and ```T1T2_denovo_snps```
Outputs are ```iSNPs_by_subject``` and ```iSNP_analysis_table```., and various plots

```SNP_analysis_figures``` is similar to SNP_pipelines but updated figures for publications.

```make_iSNP_table```: inputs are ```/iSNP_analysis_table``` and ```2021_08_24-Grand_Summary - MAP_analysis_summary.tsv```.  Make supplemental figures and analysis plots. Looks at the effect of coverage on iSNP calling.

```common_iSNPs.Rmd```: Makes some plots.
inputs are ```/iSNPs_by_subject/```.

```counting_suppl_table1``` scripts to anlyze plasmids and ompA types in Supplementary Table 1.
