```

**"regular"** is a statistic I developed after seeing that the Ref_cov+alternate bases did not always quite equal the total coverage.  In most cases, regular = 0, which means that the coverages do add up. There are a few bases +1 or -1.  Fewer still have greater deviaiotn but a few positions have huge deviation +/1 3000nt which probably is an indication of weird mapping problems.

**pot_true_minors** means that coverage is at least 10, "regular" is -1,0 or 1 and there are alternate SNPs that fall between 0.1 and 0.9 allele frequency (this is what *SNP_percent* means).

**pot_true_SNP** means that coverage is at least 10, "regular" is -1,0 or 1 and there are alternate SNPs that fall below 0.1 and 0.9 allele frequency (ie dominated by the alternative, nonAST allele).

**cov10** means number of bases with 10 or above coverage

**map_value1** means "map_value" (Sandeep's statistic meaning percent of the highest coverage) is 1 or less. All bases *should* be 1 or less but a few have weirdness.

```{r}
MAP_file_info <- file.info(list.files("~/Box/TIMOTHY_READ/DATA/2020-Chlamydia_Agilent_project/MAP_ASR/",full.names = T,pattern = "*.txt"))
MAP_files <- list.files("~/Box/TIMOTHY_READ/DATA/2020-Chlamydia_Agilent_project/MAP_ASR/",full.names = T,pattern = "*.txt")
MAP_files <- MAP_files[MAP_file_info$size > 1000000]
out_dir <- "~/Desktop/MAP_out_files/"
```

```{r}
for (i in seq_along(MAP_files)){
loop_file <- MAP_files[i]
f_name <- sub("_MAP.txt","",sub("//","",regmatches(loop_file, regexpr("//.{3,10}_MAP.txt", loop_file))))
MAP <- read_MAP(loop_file,f_name)
MAP_stats <- MAP_stats_summary(MAP,out_dir,f_name)
plot_MAP_histo(MAP,out_dir,f_name)
plot_MAP_coverage(MAP,out_dir,f_name)
write_potential_minors(MAP,out_dir,f_name)
write_potential_SNPs(MAP,out_dir,f_name)
}

```

Create summary table
```{r}
MAP_summaries <- list.files("~/Box/TIMOTHY_READ/DATA/2020-Chlamydia_Agilent_project/MAP_ASR/MAP_out_files/",full.names = T,pattern = "*_stats.tsv")
```
`

```{r}
MAP_summary_df <- read_tsv(MAP_summaries[1])
for (j in 2:length(MAP_summaries)) {
  temp_df <- read_tsv(MAP_summaries[j])
  MAP_summary_df <- bind_rows(MAP_summary_df,temp_df)
}
write_tsv(MAP_summary_df,here("MAP_analysis_summary.tsv"))
```
